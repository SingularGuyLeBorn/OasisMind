Gemma 3 Technical Report
Gemma Team, Google DeepMind1
We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging
in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider
coverage of languages and longer context – at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of
the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by
increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short.
The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2
for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe
significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-
4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across
benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.
1. Introduction
We present the newest version of Gemma open
language models (Gemma Team, 2024a), co-
designed with the family of Gemini frontier mod-
els (Gemini Team, 2023).
This new version
comes in sizes comparable to Gemma 2 (Gemma
Team, 2024b), with the addition of a 1B model.
These models are designed to run on standard
consumer-grade hardware such as phones, lap-
tops, and high-end GPUs. This version comes
with several new abilities to the Gemma family;
namely, multimodality, long context, and mul-
tilinguality, while preserving or surpassing the
performance of prior versions.
In terms of multimodality, most Gemma 3 mod-
els are compatible with a tailored version of the
SigLIP vision encoder (Zhai et al., 2023). The
language models treat images as a sequence of
soft tokens encoded by SigLIP. We reduce the in-
ference cost of image processing by condensing
the vision embeddings into a fixed size of 256
vectors. The encoder works at a fixed resolution
and we take inspiration from LLaVA (Liu et al.,
2024) to enable flexible resolutions with a Pan
and Scan (P&S) method.
The second main architectural improvement is
an increase in context size to 128K tokens, with-
out reducing performance. A challenge with long
context is the memory explosion of the KV cache
during inference. To reduce this issue, we inter-
leave multiple local layers between each global
layer, and assign a smaller span of only 1024
tokens to the local layers. Therefore, only the
global layers attend to long context, and we have
1 global for every 5 local layers.
The pre-training optimization recipe is similar
to Gemma 2, with some modifications in the ar-
chitecture design. We use the same tokenizer as
Gemini 2.0, and we also revisit our data mixture
to improve the multilingual capabilities of the
models, while introducing image understanding.
All Gemma 3 models are trained with knowledge
distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).
In post-training, we focus our efforts on im-
proving mathematics, reasoning, and chat abili-
ties, as well as integrating the new capabilities of
Gemma 3, long-context, and image inputs. We
use a novel post-training approach that brings
gains across all capabilities, including math, cod-
ing, chat, instruction following, and multilingual.
The resulting Gemma 3 instruction-tuned models
are both powerful and versatile, outperforming
their predecessors by a wide margin.
In the following sections, we provide a brief
overview of our models, including the architec-
ture and pre- and post-training recipes. We also
provide detailed evaluations across a wide vari-
ety of quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.
We discuss our approach to safe and responsible
deployment and outline the broader implications
of Gemma 3, its limitations, and advantages.

Gemma 3 27B IT model.
2. Model Architecture
Gemma 3 models follow the same general
decoder-only transformer architecture as previ-
ous iterations (Vaswani et al., 2017), with most
architecture elements similar to the first two
Gemma versions. We use a Grouped-Query Atten-
tion (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) with post-norm
and pre-norm with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sen-
nrich, 2019). Inspired by Dehghani et al. (2023),
Wortsman et al. (2023) and Chameleon Team
(2024), we replace the soft-capping of Gemma 2
with QK-norm. In this section, we focus on some
key differences from previous versions below.

attention (Luong et al., 2015), with a pattern of
5 local layers for every global layer, starting with
a local layer as the first layer of the model.
Long context. Gemma 3 models support context
length of 128K tokens, with the exception of the
1B model that has 32K. We increase RoPE base
frequency from 10k to 1M on global self-attention
layers, and keep the frequency of the local lay-
ers at 10k. We follow a process similar to the
positional interpolation of Chen et al. (2023) to
extend the span of the global self-attention layers.
2.1. Vision modality
Vision encoder. We use a 400M variant of the
SigLIP encoder (Zhai et al., 2023), a Vision Trans-
former (Dosovitskiy, 2020) trained with a varia-
tion of the CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). The
Gemma vision encoder takes as input square im-
ages resized to 896 x 896, and is finetuned on
data from visual assistant tasks. For simplicity, we
share the vision encoder across our 4B, 12B, and
27B models, keeping it frozen during training.
Pan & Scan (P&S). The Gemma vision encoder
operates at a fixed resolution of 896 × 896. This
results in artifacts when processing non-square
aspect ratios and high-resolution images, leading
to unreadable text, or small objects disappearing.
We address this issue with an adaptive windowing
algorithm during inference. This algorithm seg-
ments images into non-overlapping crops of equal
size, covering the whole image, and resize them
to 896×896 pixels to pass them to the encoder.
This windowing is applied only when necessary,
and control for the maximum number of crops.
It is an inference-time only optimization and can
be disabled for faster inference.

2.2. Pre-training
We follow a similar recipe as in Gemma 2 for
pre-training with knowledge distillation.
Training data. We pre-train our models on a
slightly larger token budget than Gemma 2, i.e.,
we train on 14T tokens for Gemma 3 27B, 12T
for the 12B version, 4T for the 4B, and 2T to-
kens for the 1B. The increase in tokens accounts
for the mix of images and text used during pre-
training. We also increase the amount of multi-
lingual data to improve language coverage. We
add both monolingual and parallel data, and we
handle the imbalance in language representation
using a strategy inspired by Chung et al. (2023).
Tokenizer. We use the same tokenizer as Gem-
ini 2.0: a SentencePiece tokenizer with split dig-
its, preserved whitespace, and byte-level encod-
ings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). The resulting
vocabulary has 262k entries. This tokenizer is
more balanced for non-English languages.
Filtering. We use filtering techniques that reduce
the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances and
remove certain personal information and other
sensitive data. We decontaminate evaluation sets
from our pre-training data mixture, and reduce
the risk of recitation by minimizing the prolifer-
ation of sensitive outputs. We also apply a qual-
ity reweighing step inspired by Sachdeva et al.
(2024) to reduce occurrences of low quality data.
Distillation. We sample 256 logits per token,
weighted by teacher probabilities. The student
learns the teacher’s distribution within these sam-
ples via cross-entropy loss. The teacher’s target
distribution is set to zero probability for non-
sampled logits, and renormalized.

points for weights and KV caching (+KV) at
32,768 context size, quantized in 8 bits.
2.3. Quantization Aware Training
Along with the raw checkpoints, we also provide
quantized versions of our models in different stan-
dard formats. These versions are obtained by fine-
tuning each model for a small number of steps,
typically 5,000, using Quantization Aware Train-
ing (QAT) (Jacob et al., 2018). We use prob-
abilities from the non-quantized checkpoint as
targets, and adapt the data to match the pre-
training and post-training distributions. Based
on the most popular open source quantization
inference engines (e.g. llama.cpp), we focus on
three weight representations: per-channel int4,
per-block int4, and switched fp8. In Table 3, we
report the memory filled by raw and quantized
models for each weight representation with and
without a KV-cache for a sequence of 32k tokens.
2.4. Compute Infrastructure
We train our models with TPUv4, TPUv5e, and
TPUv5p as outlined in Table 2. Each model con-
figuration is optimized to minimize training step
time. For the vision encoder, we pre-compute
the embeddings for each image and directly train
with the embeddings, adding no cost to the train-
ing of the language models.
The optimizer state is sharded using an im-
plementation of ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021). For
multi-pod training, we perform a data replica re-

duction over the data center network, using the
Pathways approach of Barham et al. (2022). We
use the ‘single controller’ programming paradigm
of Jax (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways
(Barham et al., 2022), along with the GSPMD
partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) and the MegaScale
XLA compiler (XLA, 2019).
3. Instruction-Tuning
Pre-trained models are turned into instruction-
tuned models with an improved post-training ap-
proach compared to our prior recipe (see Table 6).
Techniques. Our post-training approach relies
on an improved version of knowledge distilla-
tion (Agarwal et al., 2024; Anil et al., 2018; Hin-
ton et al., 2015) from a large IT teacher, along
with a RL finetuning phase based on improved ver-
sions of BOND (Sessa et al., 2024), WARM (Ramé
et al., 2024b), and WARP (Ramé et al., 2024a).
Reinforcement learning objectives.
We use
a variety of reward functions to improve help-
fulness, math, coding, reasoning, instruction-
following, and multilingual abilities, while mini-
mizing model harmfulness. This includes learn-
ing from weight averaged reward models (Ramé
et al., 2024b) trained with human feedback data,
code execution feedback (Gehring et al., 2024),
and ground-truth rewards for solving math prob-
lems (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Lambert et al., 2024).
Data filtering. We carefully optimize the data
used in post-training to maximize model perfor-
mance. We filter examples that show certain per-
sonal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs,
mistaken self-identification data, and duplicated
examples. Including subsets of data that encour-
age better in-context attribution, hedging, and
refusals to minimize hallucinations also improves
performance on factuality metrics, without de-
grading model performance on other metrics.
[BOS] token. For both PT and IT models, text
starts with a [BOS] token, that needs to be added
explicitly since the text “[BOS]” does not map to
the [BOS] token. For instance, Flax has an option,
add_bos=True, to add this token automatically
when tokenizing. An example of the formatting
for an IT model is shown in Table 4,
PT versus IT Formatting. All models share the
same tokenizer, with some control tokens dedi-
cated to IT formatting. A key difference is that PT
models output a <eos> token at the end of gener-
ation, while IT models output a <end_of_turn>
at the end of the generation, as shown for IT in
Table 4. Fine-tuning either model type thus also
requires adding their respective end tokens.
4. Evaluation of final models
In this section, we evaluate the IT models over
a series of automated benchmarks and human
evaluations across a variety of domains, as well
as static benchmarks such as MMLU.
4.1. LMSYS Chatbot Arena
In this section, we report the performance of our
IT 27B model on LMSys Chatbot Arena (Chiang
et al., 2024) in blind side-by-side evaluations by
human raters against other state-of-the-art mod-
els. We report Elo scores in Table 5. Gemma 3 27B

Table 5 
| Evaluation of Gemma 3 27B IT model in the Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024). All the
models are evaluated against each other through blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters. Each
model is attributed a score, based on the Elo rating system. Gemma-3-27B-IT numbers are preliminary
results received on March 8, 2025.
IT (1338) is among the top 10 best models, with a
score above other non-thinking open models, such
as DeepSeek-V3 (1318), LLaMA 3 405B (1257),
and Qwen2.5-70B (1257), which are much larger
models. Finally, the Elo of Gemma 3 is signifi-
cantly higher than Gemma 2, at 1220. Note that
Elo scores do not take into account visual abilities,
which none of the aforementioned models have.
4.2. Standard benchmarks
In Table 6, we show the performance of our final
models across a variety of benchmarks compared
to our previous model iteration, and Gemini 1.5.
We do not compare directly with external models
that often report their own evaluation settings,
since running them in our setting does not guaran-
tee a fair comparison. We encourage the reader to
follow third-party static leaderboards for a fairer
comparison across models. We include additional
evaluations of our models on other benchmarks
in the appendix.
5. Ablations
In this section, we focus on the impact of our
architecture changes, as well as some of the vision
abilities new to this model.
5.1. Pre-training ability probing
We use several standard benchmarks as probes
during pre-training to ensure our models capture
general abilities, and in Figure 2, we compare the
quality of pre-trained models from Gemma 2 and
3 across these general abilities, namely, science,

vision. The details of the performance across the
different public benchmarks used in these plots
are summarized in the appendix. Overall, we see
that the new versions improve in most categories,
despite the addition of vision. We particularly
focus on multilinguality in this version, and this
directly impacts the quality of our models. How-
ever, despite the use of decontamination tech-
niques, there is always a risk of contamination
of these probes (Mirzadeh et al., 2024), making
more definitive conclusions harder to assess.
5.2. Local:Global attention layers
We measure the impact of changes to local and
global self-attention layers on performance and
memory consumption during inference.

Impact on KV cache memory. In Fig. 5, we show
the balance between the memory used by the
model and the KV cache during inference with a
context of 32k tokens. The “global only” configu-
ration is the standard configuration used across
most dense models. The “1:1, sw=4096” is used
in Gemma 2. We observe that the “global only”
configuration results in a memory overhead of
60%, while this is reduced to less than 15% with
1:3 and sliding windows of 1024 (“sw=1024”).
In Fig. 6, we compute the memory used by the
KV cache as a function of the context length with
either our 2B architecture (L:G=5:1, sw=1024)
versus a “global only” 2B model.

quences and then scale the 4B, 12B, and 27B mod-
els up to 128K tokens at the end of pre-training
while rescaling RoPE (Chen et al., 2023). We
find a scaling factor of 8 to work well in practice.
Note that compared to Gemma 2, we have also
increased the RoPE base frequency of global self-
attention layers from 10k to 1M, while keeping
10k for the local self-attention layers. In Figure 7,
we show the impact on perplexity for different
context lengths. Our models generalize to 128K,
but rapidly degrade as we continue to scale.

trained models before and after RoPE rescaling.
5.4. Small versus large teacher
A common finding is that, to train a small model,
it is preferable to distill from a smaller teacher.

 Perplexity
Figure 8 | Small versus large teacher. Relative
difference of perplexity when using a small and
large teacher as a function of the token size of
training. Smaller numbers means distilling from
a larger teacher is better.
We suspect this is because these studies are often
performed in settings where the regularization ef-
fect of using a worse teacher surpasses the benefit
of using a better teacher. We train a student with
2 teachers of different sizes, one large and one
small, for different training horizons. In Fig. 8,
we observe that for short training horizons, the
smaller teacher is better, but the trend is reversed
for longer training.

Impact of image resolution. We use a vision
encoder based on SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023). The
vision encoder is frozen, and only the language
model is trained. Each image in this multimodal
data is represented by 256 image tokens from
the respective vision encoder. The higher resolu-
tion encoders thus use average pooling to reduce
their output to 256 tokens. For instance, the 896
resolution encoder has a 4x4 average pooling on
its output. As shown in Table 7, higher resolution
encoders perform better than smaller ones.

Pan & Scan. P&S enables capturing images at
close to their native aspect ratio and image reso-
lution. In Table 8, we compare our 27B IT model
with and without P&S. As expected, the ability
to treat images with close to native resolution
greatly helps with tasks that require some form
of reading text on images, which is particularly
important for visual language models.
6. Memorization and Privacy
Large language models may produce near-copies
of some text used in training (Biderman et al.,
2023; Carlini et al., 2021, 2022; Ippolito et al.,
2022; Nasr et al., 2023). Several prior reports
have released audits that quantify this risk by
measuring the memorization rate (Anil et al.,
2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Gemini Team,
2023, 2024; Gemma Team, 2024a,b; LLaMa
Team, 2024). This “memorization rate”1 is de-
fined as the ratio of generations from the model
that match its training data compared to all model
generations using the following setup. We fol-
low the methodology described in Gemma Team
1"We do not state or imply [here] that a model "contains"
its training data in the sense that there is a copy of that data
in the model. Rather, a model memorizes attributes of its
training data such that in certain cases it is statistically able
to generate such training data when following rules and
using information about features of its training data that it
does contain."

(2024b) to measure it. Specifically, we subsam-
ple a large portion of training data distributed
uniformly across different corpora and test for
discoverable extraction (Nasr et al., 2023) of this
content using a prefix of length 50 and a suffix of
length 50. We denote text as either “exactly mem-
orized” if all tokens in the continuation match
the source suffix or “approximately memorized”
if they match up to an edit distance of 10%.
Figure 9 compares the memorization rates
across Gemma and Gemini models; these models
are ordered in reverse chronological order, with
the newest Gemma 3 models on the left. We find
that Gemma 3 models memorize long-form text
at a much lower rate than prior models (note the
log y-axis). We observe only a marginal differ-
ence in the memorization rates between the 4B,
12B, and 27B models, with 1B memorizing less
than these larger models. Further, we find that a
larger proportion of text is characterized as ap-
proximately memorized, with a relative increase
in approximate memorization compared to exact
memorization of roughly 24x on average.
We also study the rate at which the generations
may contain personal information. To identify po-
tentially personal information, we use the Google
Cloud Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) service.2
SDP uses broad detection rules to identify text
that may contain personal information. SDP is
2https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection
designed to have high recall and does not con-
sider the context in which the information may
appear, which leads to many false positives. Thus,
we are likely overestimating the true amount of
potentially personal information contained in the
outputs classified as memorized. SDP also pro-
vides broad severity levels: low, medium, and
high. We classify text as personal if SDP clas-
sifies it as personal information at any severity
level. We observed no personal information in
the outputs characterized as memorization for all
Gemma 3 models. This indicates a low rate of
personal data, below our detection thresholds, in
outputs classified as memorization.
7. Responsibility, Safety, Security
Responsibility, safety, and security are of utmost
importance in the development of Gemma mod-
els. To reduce risks to Gemma 3 users, we have
continued to integrate enhanced internal safety
processes that span the development workflow,
in line with recent Google AI models (Gemini
Team, 2024). This focuses on safety mitigation at
training time, and robust and t
